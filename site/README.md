## Remindoro Site

This is an `svelte` app. Site is built with `svelte` because for such a simple site there is no need to have an runtime like `React`.

## Commands

- `yarn site:dev` - Runs a local dev server
- `yarn site:build` - Builds prod build in `docs` folder (which is deployed to github pages)

Please note, all the site dependencies including `svelte` is added as dev dependency in the main `package.json`.
